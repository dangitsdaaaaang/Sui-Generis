# Sui Generis - A Cultural Innovation Expansion mod for Crusader Kings 3
_Sui Generis_ was designed with two objectives in mind: firstly that each culture in the game should be governed by a unique mechanic that distinguishes it from others on the basis of their culture group or geographic location, and secondly that select unique cultural innovations should be able to spread far beyond their origins to enrich the various cultures of the medieval world. 

Currently, the mod features innovations for the following culture groups:
## Arabic:
- Fatḥ al-Andalus _(available to Andalusian, Maghrebi, and Berber cultures with a presence in the Iberian region)_: Enables raiding, though at a significantly slower rate, of foreign counties within the Iberian region for piety **if of a different religion** scaled to the ruler's martial skill, +4 Advantage in Controlled Territory
- Alcazabas _(available to the Andalusians, can be exported to the Iberian culture group)_: +1 Fort Level, +20% Hostile Raid Time, +50% Garrison Size, +25% Castle Holding Construction Cost
- Ghilman _(available to Arabic culture group cultures in the Middle East, may spread to any predominantly Islamic culture)_: -33% Men-at-Arms Maintenance, +2 Men-at-Arms Regiments, -25% Levy Size, -50% Levy Reinforcement Rate
- Damascene Steel _(available to Arabic culture group cultures in the Middle East, may spread to any sufficiently advanced culture, requires a county with 20 Development or higher and a duchy building from the Blacksmith line constructed in it)_: +15% Knight Effectiveness, bonus damage for heavy cavalry
## Berbers:
- Barb Horses _(can be exported to other cultures)_: bonus damage, toughness, and pursuit for light cavalry

## Frankish:
- Seigneurialism _(requires Manorialism, can be exported to English and Scottish cultures)_: +25% Domain Tax, +15% Levy Size, +10% County Control Gain **BUT** -2 Domain Limit if ruler is a Duke or higher tier and either independent or holding more than 4 counties, -25% Vassal Tax Contribution Multiplier, -33% Vassal Levy Contribution Multiplier, and -15 Popular Opinion 
- Peerage _(can be exported to English and Scottish cultures)_: Unlocks unique Peerage vassal contract available only to Duke-tier or higher Powerful Vassals, which partially negates Vassal Tax Contribution Multiplier penalty from Seigneurialism and grants a Hostile Scheme Resistance bonus. Independent lieges who grant Peerage titles receive a periodic homage of prestige and piety based on the opinions of their Peers and the Realm Priest

- Ostsiedlung: +15% Development/month, may flip counties in bordering realms to your culture, which can be increased if a city in that county has the unique Rathaus building
- German Town Law _(can be exported to other primarily Christian cultures, but cannot be adopted by any culture that has adopted Seigneurialism)_: Unlocks the unique Rathaus building line for city holdings, which provides a bonus to Development/month
## Persian:
- Parsi Renaissance _(requires a county of 20 Development or higher)_: +1.0 Development Growth/month in the capital county
