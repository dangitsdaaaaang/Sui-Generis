 innovation_barbary_corsairs:1 "Barbary Corsairs"
 innovation_barbary_corsairs_desc:1 "Though the practice of piracy and raiding had always plagued the Mediterranean, the coastal Berber states were able to vastly enrich themselves at the expense of their European neighbors. Such razzias were such a thorn in the side of Italian, French, and Iberian rulers that the Sicilian Normans invaded North Africa in 1135, and in 1390, a French-Genoese joint military expedition embarked on the short-lived Barbary Crusade."

 innovation_persian_court_literature_iranian_desc:1 "Despite having been momentarily eclipsed by Arabic as the language of prestige in the Muslim world, the great literary tradition of the Persians resurged in the latter half of the first millenium, fueled by a longing for the restoration of a national identity. For centuries afterward, Persian language and culture became the primary influence upon the extravagant courts and sprawling cities not only of Persia proper, but also the far reaches of Muslim-ruled India and the steppes of Central Asia and beyond."

 innovation_iranian_epic_verse_desc:1 "The flourishing of Persian culture and letters gave rise to an astoundingly vibrant poetic tradition. Verses skillfully composed for their wit and brevity began to make their way into the common language, while more elevated, courtly verses embellished the feats of great kings of ages past and present. The most famous of these was the #italic Shahnameh#! by Ferdowsi, the monumental labor of almost 30 years serving as a tribute to and inspiration for the spirit and prowess of the Persian people."

 innovation_legacy_of_rome_desc:1 "Despite the fall of the empire in the West, the imperial tradition of the Romans remains strong in the East where the authority of a strong ruler is still to be respected and feared. Hardened by centuries of battling for survival against myriad foes, true Romans understand that might makes right, and the shining beacon of civilization can only be upheld by a will of iron."
 
 innovation_legacy_of_byzantium:1 "Legacy of the Autokrator"
 innovation_legacy_of_byzantium_desc:1 "Tales of the splendor of the imperial court at Constantinople served as a dazzling inspiration to many of the burgeoning powers of Asia Minor and Eastern Europe. Awed by the wealth and grandeur of the Basileus and the absolute authority he exercised over the empire of the Romans, lesser rulers sought to emulate what they perceived as power granted directly by the will of God to exert their will over their subjects."

 innovation_caucasian_diplomacy:1 "Caucasian Diplomacy"
 innovation_caucasian_diplomacy_desc:1 "As Muslim invaders and steppe hordes made their incursions into the heart of the Caucasus, it became more and more important to consider pragmatic alliances when dynastic bonds could not be forged. This relative understanding and cooperation in the face of fierce hostility bore many fruitful military alliances between Georgian, Armenian and Alan states, both with and against their powerful neighbor, the Byzantine Roman Empire."

Their heavy cavalry repulsed larger armies time and time again, and even when the Turkic and Mongol hordes finally displaced them from their mountain halls, these noble cavaliers fought on and served as an integral part in the armies of both their Eastern brothers in faith and their Crusader neighbors."

 innovation_seigneurialism_desc:1 "By delegating more responsibilities and privileges to the lower nobility, more control could be exerted over the peasantry to extract even more taxes and levies, though from a greatly reduced domain to make administration more manageable. This system became somewhat infamous for forcing formerly free alloidal lands and their residents to become bound to the lord's manor, inspiring popular memories of tyrannical lords oppressing their helpless serfs."

 innovation_norman_customary_law_desc:1 "Combining aspects of Scandinavian tradition with the laws and customs of the lands they settled, the Normans developed unique traditions that survive even to the present day in areas of the former Duchy of Normandy. One noticeable practice was the designation of one's heir regardless of the social status of the mother, which allowed lesser or illegitimate sons to assume the mantle of leadership, such as Richard I of Normandy, Roger II of Sicily, and more famously, William the Conqueror."

Though the Empire had united the tribal kingdoms into a single polity and granted them a single throne for which to vie, the regional stem duchies persisted and would serve as the powerbases of the great princely houses until they one by one fell into disarray or were dismantled, more often than not at the hands of vengeful Emperors."

The most famous of these were the Magdeburg rights and later the Lübeck law, which arbitrated disputes and protected the rights of all citizens regardless of culture or creed. Not only did these laws promote trade and commerce locally, but also allowed for the rise of extensive trading networks all over Christian Eastern Europe."

 #Iberian
 innovation_reconquista:1 "Reconquista"
 innovation_reconquista_desc:1 "For centuries, Christian and Moorish rulers battled for not only religious, but also cultural supremacy over the Iberian peninsula. However, the hostilities tended to ebb and flow between the rivalling faiths just as much as they did between rulers of the same faith, and it was not uncommon for men who considered each other infidels to fight alongside each other against a common enemy. Guided more by expediency and opportunity for expansion than true zeal, the warrior-kings of Christian Spain often sought religious conflict, regardless of who they fought with or against, as a means to bring glory and wealth to their kingdoms."
 innovation_reconquista_muslim:1 "Fatḥ al-Andalus"
 innovation_reconquista_muslim_desc:1 "For centuries, Christian and Moorish rulers battled for not only religious, but also cultural supremacy over the Iberian peninsula. Though at first the lack of cohesion among the Christian natives faciliated the rapid conquest and integration of the muwalladun into the Muslim world, fierce resistance, difficult terrain, and a developing warrior culture in the north proved too difficult to dispel. By the late 10th century, threatened by an ever-emboldened foe, the various Moorish taifas were faced with a terrible choice: unite the squabbling factions and repel the aggression of their northern neighbors by the sword or die by it."

 innovation_iberian_military_orders_desc:1 "One of the natural developments of the intertwining of religious devotion and warlikeness was the tradition of military knightly orders - brothers sworn to devote their lives to defend the faithful against the heathen. Often these orders were royally sponsored and granted tracts of land in order to help sustain themselves, becoming powerful influences in their respective realms. Their status and renown for their feats of arms served as an inspiration for many, both noble and lowborn, to take up the sword for Christ."

Serving both as expansive palaces and extensive fortifications, they left a remarkable impression on the Christians to the north, who left them largely intact or emulated their construction in their own cities.
