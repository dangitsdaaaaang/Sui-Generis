 innovation_ghilman:1 "The reliance on slave-soldiers as a professional fighting force was preferable to relying on local warlords or militias to supply soldiers. Drawn from Turkish slaves captured and raised in their masters' personal households, ghulam slave-soldiers became a staple throughout the Muslim world not only of the military, but also of government. Some were given command of large territories and carved out autonomous, if not sometimes outright independent, states."

 innovation_barbary_corsairs_desc:1 "Though the practice of piracy and raiding had always plagued the Mediterranean, the coastal Berber states were able to vastly enrich themselves at the expense of their European neighbors. Such razzias were such a thorn in the side of Italian, French, and Iberian rulers that the Sicilian Normans invaded North Africa in 1135, and in 1390, a French-Genoese joint military expedition embarked on the short-lived Barbary Crusade."

 innovation_reconquista:1 "Reconquista"
 innovation_reconquista_desc:1 "For centuries, Christian and Moorish rulers battled for not only religious, but also cultural supremacy over the Iberian peninsula. However, the hostilities tended to ebb and flow between the rivalling faiths just as much as they did between rulers of the same faith, and it was not uncommon for men who considered each other infidels to fight alongside each other against a common enemy. Guided more by expediency and opportunity for expansion than true zeal, the warrior-kings of Christian Spain often sought religious conflict, regardless of who they fought with or against, as a means to bring glory and wealth to their kingdoms."

By the late 10th century, threatened by an ever-emboldened foe, the various Moorish taifas were faced with a terrible choice: unite the squabbling factions and repel the aggression of their northern neighbors by the sword or die by it."

Serving both as expansive palaces and extensive fortifications, they left a remarkable impression on the Christians to the north, who left them largely intact or emulated their construction in their own cities."
